### Rock, Paper, Scissors + Lizard + Spock EXTENDED (Including Class)
For the third version of the game, I switched up gears a bit and split it into 3 files:
1. [The main file](https://github.com/Newton-Musyimi/Learning-C-and-CPP/blob/master/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Extended/rpslsGAME.cpp) which initializes the game and starts it. (**13 lines of code**)
2. [The header file](https://github.com/Newton-Musyimi/Learning-C-and-CPP/blob/master/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Extended/rpsls.hpp) which contains the class definition and the class members' declaration. (**26 lines of code**)
3. [The logic file](https://github.com/Newton-Musyimi/Learning-C-and-CPP/blob/master/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Extended/rpsls.cpp) Where the game logic is coded. Also where the class member methods declaredin the header file are defined. (**351 lines of code**)
